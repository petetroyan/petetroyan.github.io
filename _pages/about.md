I am an associate professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Virginia. Prior to joining UVA, I did my undergraduate work at the University of Michigan and received a Ph.D. in Economics from Stanford University in 2014.

My research focuses on economic theory, game theory, and experimental economics, with an emphasis on auctions, matching, and market design. Links to all of my papers can be found under the Research tab above.
